## Exploration
New York is renowned as one of the worlds hubs for entertainment. In this data exploration we will take a look at the New York movie scene as well as the scenes of other countries to see what is being developed (i.e. what is Film, Television, WEB). We will also explore what impacts (if any) covid 19 had on the filming scene. Conclusively we will explore the role of police precincts within the filming environment. This exploration will encompass two main result presenting mediums, one: numerical tables and two: graphical visualisations. The former will be used to provide a more in-depth understanding of the data and the latter will provide an overall easy to grasp view.
